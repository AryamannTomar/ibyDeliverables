            That is our ideal. We will create a society, where the children can live their lives as they are,<br>

            that is closer to people than people. We continue to challenge ourselves every day<br> 
            to turn the suffering of COVID-19 into the joy of the next generation.<br>

    <div class="content"><p>I was born as the third son of a civil servant couple in a country town, studied at a public elementary school,
        junior high school, high school and university, worked for a company as an office worker, and have lived an
        ordinary life.</p><p>The change came when my son, who had been so lively and happy, lost his energy as soon as he entered
        elementary school.</p><p>Everyone sits in their assigned seats at their assigned times and takes their assigned classes together. My son
        could not understand why this was so. We have destroyed many of the irreplaceable individuality of each person
        with our system for efficiency. I just couldn't tell my son that this system was the norm.</p><p>We all three quit our jobs at NTTDATA, a large corporation, and started this company. This was because we had
        a strong desire to change the world's standard of measurement to something that suits the individuality of each
        person, not just test scores. For the sake of our children, we will change this society into a school, where each
        individual is accepted, respected, and learned from.</p><p>We will keep challenging ourselves until we turn the whole society into a school.</p></div>
